When it comes to websites, the layout, graphics, and how easily it is to navigate through it plays an important role in determining how people view you or the company. 

It is also a way to comment your code. For example, when creating a navigation bar, I can name its class, 'ui topmenu menu'. With this naming convention, I will easily know what section of the website the code is referring to. It also gives you the opportunity to break the website into their own section and organizing them into containers, groups, and items. For example, the website below could be broken down into a navigation bar, body, and footer. Semantic UI lets you combine the contents of these sections together to create an appealing and functional website.
