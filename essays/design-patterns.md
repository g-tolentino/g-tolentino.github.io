## Building A Lego Block

A professor once told me, "programming is like creating a bunch of lego pieces and putting them together to create something new." After three years of programming in languages such as C, C++, Java, and JavaScript, I've noticed that the code I've writen is broken down into small "lego blocks". Some of these blocks are reusable in multiple different programs, they also could be altered to create new blocks. For example, the input of a function could be different from another, but their structures are somewhat similar. These lego blocks resemble design patterns which are reusable solutions to common problems in software design.
