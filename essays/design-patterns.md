## Building A Lego Block

A professor once told me, "programming is like creating a bunch of lego pieces and putting them together to create something new." After three years of programming in languages such as C, C++, Java, and JavaScript, I've noticed that my code could be broken down into small "lego blocks". Some of these blocks are reusable in multiple different programs, they also could be altered to create new blocks. For example, the input of a function could be different from another, but their structures are somewhat similar.
