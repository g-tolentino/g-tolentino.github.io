## Good VS. Bad Questions

When looking at questions on StackOverflow, the first thing users see is a list of subject headers to each question. According to Raymond and Moen [1], the subject header is your way of attracting fellow software engineers to your question, similar to the first sentence of an essay. You want them to know more about your question and what you’re having trouble with. You’re subject header should also be descriptive, but concise as well. Looking at figure 1, the subject header is excessive. The phrase, “Hello Everyone, I need help, I would like to know how to make some few exercises” is unnecessary, instead, it should be included in the detailed description of the question. An effective subject header would be: “Calculating Leap Year with C++.” In figure 2, the subject header is a short and concise question, then the question is expanded in the description. In the description of your problem, it should clearly describe the bug, the environment, demonstrate that you researched your problem, and show the steps you took in attempting to solve your problem before posting. In an essay, the description acts as the body. In figure 1’s description, they clearly restate their subject header which defeats the purpose. They also do not include an attempt to solving their question. Showing no attempt, it demonstrates that you are only searching for answers and have no interest in working out the problem.
