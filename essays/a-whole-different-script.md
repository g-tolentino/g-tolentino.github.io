## Simple Yet Powerful
After a week of getting familiar with JavaScript, "simple" is the word that comes to mind when I hear "JavaScript". In the past I've worked with Java, C, and C++ so when I entered  ICS 314, I thought we would use one of those programming languages or something similar. Going through the "FreeCodeCamp" exercises, it was easy for me to understand its unique syntax because there were similarities to Java, C, and C++. Compared to these programming languages, JavaScript is "simple" because programmers do not have to declare the datatypes of their variables. This is an interesting feature because programmers do not have to worry about making sure their variable is a float or double instead of an int or keep track of the datatypes of their variables. Another feature that I thought was interesting was the ability to store different datatypes and not having to declare the size of an array. For example, I could have strings of names and integers of ages all in one and constantly add as much data into the array.
