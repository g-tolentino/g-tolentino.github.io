## Overview
### The Problem
Millions of food are being thrown out everyday due to expiration dates. One of the causes is forgetting when products expire and losing track of what we already have in your fridge and/or pantry. 
### The Solution
The Grocery Manager application allows you list your groceries into different types of categories along with expiration date, quantity, and price. Based on the expiration date, the application will notify you when a product is about to expire or you start to run out. As the item gets low or gets close to its expiration date, the app will automatically add the item to a shopping list. 

## Mock Page Ideas
<ul>
  <li>Landing Page</li>
  <li>Shopping List</li>
  <li>Inventory</li>
</ul>

## Use Case Ideas
<ul>
  <li>User goes to landing page, logs in or signs up, then automatically goes to inventory page.</li>
  <li>If there are expired or low quantity items, they would be shown at the top.</li>
</ul>

## Beyond The Basics
<ul>
  <li>The user is able to input how often they use the product and will automatically subtract from the overall quantity.</li>
  <li>When a product has expired or run out, an email will be sent with the list of products.</li>
</ul>
