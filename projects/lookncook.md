overview of the project, what your contributions to the project were, what you learned from this experience

Being one of the thousands of students who dorm on campus, I am constantly wondering what to cook for lunch or dinner. Sometimes I am searching on the web for hours and just end up cooking a packet of ramen or going out and spending money on take out. To solve this situation, my team created Look 'N' Cook.
 
Look 'N' Cook is a web application that my team created for our ICS 314 final project. Our goal for this project was to create an application that would provide UH students a way to share their recipes and learn from others. In addition to recipes, vendors such as Foodland, Safeway, and Longs Drugs could create accounts and provide information about the products/ingredients that they have available for purchase.
