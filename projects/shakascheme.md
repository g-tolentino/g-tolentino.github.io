summary: Created rules and test cases for variable and boolean for a Scheme interpreter. 
---

Entering this project, I had very little experience with programming. So I decided to join the Design/Testing team. We started the semester by researching regular language and Backus-Naur Form (BNF). After a couple of weeks of research and trying to understand BNF and regular language, I was moved to the Parsing/IO team. As part of the Parsing/IO team, I used what I learned about BNF and regular language to parse code and create rules for variable and boolean. In addition to coding rules for variable and boolean, I created test cases with Google Test to make sure my rules were producing the correct results.  

Being a part of this project helped me better understand programming languages and their syntax, the concept of parsing, and working with a big team. Having documents like R7RS, helped me create rules for variable and boolean without having a lot of experience with programming in Scheme. Also, working with a big team which consisted of sophomores, juniors, and seniors, it gave me the chance to see their coding habits and how they would tackle a problem.
